# Project P1 ‚Äì BLE Contact Tracer with Exposure Logic and Energy Budget

## üì° Project Overview

In the context of virus outbreaks such as COVID-19, digital contact tracing has emerged as a promising tool for early detection and transmission mitigation. This project builds on those principles to explore decentralized BLE-based solutions for proximity sensing, privacy preservation, and energy-efficient deployment in wireless IoT systems.

In this project, you are required to build a decentralized BLE-based contact tracing system using **ESP32-C6 devices**. Each device must advertise a randomized identifier and simultaneously scan for nearby identifiers. Devices should log all contact encounters with associated timestamps and RSSI values, enabling proximity estimation and exposure tracking.

You will define and implement an exposure rule (e.g., "cumulative proximity ‚â• 5 minutes within 1.5 meters"), calibrate the RSSI‚Äìdistance relationship through controlled experiments, and evaluate the system's detection accuracy, false positives/negatives, and energy consumption. Data analysis can be performed locally on the devices or post-processed on a PC.

# Project P2 ‚Äì LoRaWAN Interactive Peer-Messaging Service

## üì° Project Overview

In large-scale sensor deployments using LoRaWAN, devices can only receive downlink messages immediately following their own uplinks. This constraint complicates direct communication between devices. In this project, you will implement a lightweight, asynchronous messaging protocol where any device can initiate a communication session with another peer by interacting with a centralized application server.

The system works as follows:

1. All devices periodically send **keepalive uplinks** (e.g., every 60‚Äì120 seconds) to indicate they are active.
2. These uplinks are collected by the application server (Python script subscribed to the TTN MQTT feed), which maintains a dynamic list of recently seen device IDs.
3. Any device can initiate communication by sending a **DISCOVER uplink**, requesting the current list of active device IDs.
4. The application server responds with a **ROSTER downlink** containing this list. The ROSTER is a compact message structure encoding the IDs of devices that have recently sent uplinks (i.e., are active and reachable). It allows the requesting node to select a viable recipient for its next COMMAND message.
5. The requesting device selects a target and sends a **COMMAND uplink**, referencing the target ID and message.
6. The network server buffers the command and delivers it to the target device during its next downlink window (RX1 or RX2) following its next uplink.
7. The target device may optionally respond with an ACK or application-level response during its next scheduled uplink.

This architecture allows peer-like communication within the strict timing and energy constraints of LoRaWAN. You will evaluate this system's performance across several dimensions, including delay, delivery reliability, false message rates, and energy consumption, analyzing the system's responsiveness and reliability under realistic constraints, including duty cycle, downlink scheduling, spreading factor variation, and message queuing delay.

## üß™ Project Features and Evaluation Goals

### Core Functionality

* Any device periodically sends a DISCOVER uplink to request the list of active nodes
* The application server receives the uplink via MQTT and responds with a downlink ROSTER message
* The originating device parses the ROSTER and sends a targeted COMMAND uplink referencing a selected device ID
* The network server buffers the COMMAND and delivers it as a downlink to the target device during its next RX1 or RX2 window
* Target devices may optionally respond with an ACK uplink or a status report

### Experimental Evaluation

* **Roster discovery performance**:
  * Log number of devices discovered vs expected
  * Analyze false negatives or missed targets
* **Command delivery reliability**:
  * Measure successful command delivery ratio across multiple attempts
  * Quantify effect of transmission interval and spreading factor
* **End-to-end delay**:
  * Compute time from DISCOVER to ROSTER reception and from command to ACK
* **Energy profiling and trade-off analysis**:
  * Use the [Semtech LoRa Calculator](https://www.semtech.com/design-support/lora-calculator) to estimate energy consumption and time-on-air for different payload sizes and spreading factors
  * Explore how varying the **polling interval** of target nodes (i.e., their uplink frequency) affects:
    * Message delivery latency
    * Buffer retention time at the network server
    * Average energy cost per device
  * Quantify the trade-offs between lower latency (frequent uplinks) and energy efficiency (longer sleep intervals)
  * Estimate average power consumption under different polling intervals and SFs
